This is a commandline tool for viewing all bytes of a file.
I created it to be able to see the compressed output of my huffman code project.

--BUILD

run "cargo build --release" -> "target/release/byteread" is created

--USAGE

Since the resulting output can be very long I recommend piping the output into programs like
less or saving it to a file.

Basic usage is:

>> byteread <File>

This prints out all bytes in hex format, 8 bytes per row

--SWITCHES AND OPTIONS

-a or --ascii    -> prints a second table next to the byte table, displaying the bytes char value
                    (if above 32 and under 127, else a space character is printed)
-l or --lines    -> prints the index of the first byte of each row

-f or --format <format>         -> sets the format the bytes will be displayed in.
                                   available are: "hex", "bin" "u8" "i8"
                                   default is: "hex"
-i or --indent <number>         -> sets the number of space characters between two blocks of bytes
                                   default is: 2
-p or --pageformat <pageformat> -> pageformat has the format <blocks>:<cols>

Example of pageformat (x's are bytes and spaces are indentations):
"-p 1:8" would print like this:
    x x x x x x x x
"-p 2:6" would print like this:
    xx xx xx
"-p 3:7" would print like this:
    xxx xxx x
